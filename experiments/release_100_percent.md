# Getting to 100% of Release

To get to 100% of Release, you must control 

- **Technical Risk**.  The Feature must work.
- **User Acceptance risk.**  Users must like (or not hate) the Feature.

OR 

- **Opportunity Risk** (missing a timely window) dictates accepting higher levels of Technical or UA risk.


## Managing Technical Risk

Risks:

- Code is buggy / incorrect / incomplete.
- The code "plays poorly" with Firefox, causing crashes.
- The code causes performance problems, enough to cause users to use Firefox less often.

Methods:

- The train system.
- (optional) **preference experiment** up to 1% in a targeted population (pref vs control)
- (optional) **preference experiment** up to 1% in a targeted population (many values)
- (optional) **preference rollout**  to 99% in a targeted population
- Become default, in a point release, new Firefox version

## Managing User Acceptance Risk

The Users **don't like** your Feature / Idea.  Feature may be 'correct'.

Methods:

- Surveys (Screenshots, Max-Diff) in Firefox or other Panels.
- User Testing
- AMO
- Shield Study WebExtension
- Pref-controlled Feature Flag
