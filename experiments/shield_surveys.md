# Shield Surveys (Attitudinal Research)

Attitudinal Research:  Heartbeat, Surveys, Panels Screenshots, and Tasks

## Why Do Surveys?

- **Very fast**.  As fast as you can write text, make screenshots, or define the task.  Deploy that day, get answers by tomorrow.
- **Good enough answers** for these questions:

    - Does nobody / somebody / everyone like a thing?
    - Does nobody / somebody / everyone do a thing?
    - Does nobody / somebody / everyone understand a thing?
    - Is there an obviously right / wrong message or design?

## Which users?

- Panels (other browsers users, US census balanced)
- Existing Firefox users, the normal any channel, any percentage, any locale, any geo (and other) [targeting](targeting.md).
- within Firefox, same targeting as all Delivery Console actions.

## What tasks or feedback?

Any "text with a link" task.

- Surveys
- Direct people to a rating or ranking task
- Messaging variations / promotions
- Heatmaps of images
- UserTesting.com links
- InVision prototypes
- BrainGames / Perception Tasks
