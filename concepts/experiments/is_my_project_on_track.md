Realistic date planning.

- QA will discover problems.  They will be on inconvenient 


really, what i detest is the scramble monday mornings, before our 10am launch meeting, to figure out what reviews are still outstanding and can those be shoehorned in so that the study can go live on it's planned dates.



Also, the other outstanding concern of mine is the actual launching of studies. It seems like Rob does the majority (if not all?) of those. But what happens if Rob gets hit by a bus? Not to be grim, but that's always our scenario when contingency planning, esp in a place like Portland.
