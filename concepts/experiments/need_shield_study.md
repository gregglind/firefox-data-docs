# I Need a Shield Study

"Shield Study" conflates two related, but distinct concepts:
- gathering evidence to make decisions
- off-train deployment.

Look through the scenarios below to see which fits what you are trying to do.


### I want to talk to someone.

Cool.  Contact Us[^contact] on Slack.


### I need some evidence to make a decision.

Contact the S+I team, and let's talk about the decision, the method, and the mechanism.


### I have a Thing I want to deploy **now** into Release (or other targeted popuation).

See [Delivery Console](./off_train_deployment.md).

Some things you can deploy off-trains.

- preference 
- hotfix addon
- survey or User Task


### I have a preference I want to slowly roll-out.

See [Delivery Console](./off_train_deployment.md).


### I have an instrumented user feature, with multiple variations, that I need to compare to a simulatenous control popululation.  This is the only way I can gather evidence to make my decision.

Condolences, you may actually need a Shield Study Addon.

Please contact us during the Hypothesis Design phase, before you start building, and *especially* before you start instrumenting.  

Contacting us early helps prevent known problems.

You are an expert on your feature.  We are experts on experiments coding.

### I am still confused.

So are we most of the time.

Contact us, and will sort it out together.

<!--Are you just generally confused?

- call us and let's talk it out.


Are you writing code, because you know how to write code?


Who is looking at a github repo?
- forked
- looked at?


Experimenting at Mozilla => simple renumeration
- Do you need a shield study?
- 
- you hardly ever need a Shield Study
- surveys
- off-train deployment using Delivery Console
- 


Value Prop:
- code is expensive
- we will save you time and heartache
- get you the results you want.

We know you want to write code.  Fight that urge.


You are used to making Features.
You need to think about how to code to make probes survive the wild.
